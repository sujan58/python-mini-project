# Deepfake Detection with Streamlit

This repository contains a project for detecting deepfakes using machine learning models and Streamlit for an interactive web interface. The project is divided into three main components:

1. **Frame Extraction** (`extract_frames_streamlit.py`)
2. **Model Training** (`train_model_streamlit.py`)
3. **Deepfake Detection** (`detect_deepfake_streamlit.py`)

## Introduction

Deepfake technology has made it increasingly difficult to distinguish between real and fake media. This project provides a technical solution to detect and mitigate the spread of deepfakes by using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and an interactive Streamlit interface.

## Setup

To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sujan58/python-mini-project.git
    cd Deepfake_Streamlit
    ```

2. **Install the required dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Install additional dependencies for Streamlit:**

    ```bash
    pip install streamlit opencv-python-headless tensorflow
    ```

## Usage
## Running the Streamlit App

### You need to run each script separately using Streamlit. Open a terminal in your project directory and run:
```bash
streamlit run extract_frames_streamlit.py
```

### Then in another terminal:
```bash
streamlit run train_model_streamlit.py
```

### And finally:
```bash
streamlit run detect_deepfake_streamlit.py
```

## Dependencies
1. Python 3.6+
2. TensorFlow
3. OpenCV
4. Streamlit
