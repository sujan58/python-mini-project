## Face Recognition Project

## Overview
This project implements a face recognition system using Python, OpenCV, and Dlib. It detects faces in images or video streams and recognizes known faces based on pre-trained models. Unknown faces can be added to the system for future recognition.

## Installation
To run the face recognition system, follow these installation steps:

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sujan58/python-mini-project.git

```

## Install Dependencies:
Navigate to the project directory and install the required Python dependencies using pip:
```bash
    cd face-recognition-project
    pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## Download Models:
The script automatically downloads the required face detection and recognition models. However, if you encounter any issues, manually download the following models:
- shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat
- dlib_face_recognition_resnet_model_v1.dat

## Prepare Known Faces:
Add images of known faces to the `known_faces` directory. Ensure the images are named appropriately and contain only the face of the person to be recognized.

## Usage
After completing the installation steps, you can run the face recognition system using the following command:
'python face_recognition.py'


Follow the on-screen instructions to add new faces to the system when unknown faces are detected. Press 'a' to add a face or 'c' to continue without adding. Press 'q' to quit the application.
