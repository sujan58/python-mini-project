# Chat with AI using Groq API
This is a simple web application that allows users to chat with an AI model powered by the Groq API. The application is built using Flask for the backend and a basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend.

## Features
- User-friendly chat interface.
- Supports both text and code responses from the AI.
- Copy-to-clipboard functionality for code snippets.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sujan58/python-mini-project.git
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install flask groq
    ```

3. Replace `Enter Your API_KEY` in `app.py` with your actual Groq API key.

4. Run the Flask app:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

5. Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## Usage

1. Type your message in the input box at the bottom of the chat interface.
2. Press the "Send" button or hit "Enter" to send your message.
3. The AI's response will appear in the chat history. Code snippets will have a "Copy" button to easily copy the code to your clipboard.
